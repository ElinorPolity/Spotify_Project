# Spotify_Project
Project concludes with data mining, division of songs into groups through unsupervised learning

The database used contains more than 200,000 samples, which significantly increases the script time. For the purpose of calculating the models at standard runtime, we chose to take a small random database of 50,000 samples.

In the code you can find 4 main parts:

1. In-depth investigation of the data in order to understand features in more depth
2. Implementation of the three selected models: Kmeans,GM,DBSCAN -  and their validation using a silhouette score.
3. Visualization of the selected models. For the purpose of visualization, 4000 samples were randomly selected.
4. Playlist recommendation engine based on the song entered by the user
